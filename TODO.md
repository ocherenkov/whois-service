## TODO: Improvements for WHOIS Service

### 1. Improve Domain Validation

- Validate domain extensions by regular expression or use a list of valid extensions.

### 2. Optimize WHOIS Queries

- Store WHOIS servers per TLD in configs or DB: Use config/whois.php or a database table to dynamically manage WHOIS
  server lists.
- If a WHOIS server fails, try an alternative: Implement a retry mechanism with fallback servers in case the primary
  WHOIS server is unavailable.
- Save WHOIS data to DB for faster lookup: Store parsed WHOIS responses in a database table to reduce network requests.
- Set up a cron job to refresh WHOIS data for frequently requested domains: Use Laravel's schedule() function to update
  cached WHOIS data at regular intervals.
- Improve caching for WHOIS data: Cache WHOIS responses with different TTLs based on domain popularity (e.g., 1-day
  cache for frequently requested domains).

### 3. Spam Protection

- Use recaptcha for lookup form: Google reCAPTCHA or other reCAPTCHA services.

### 4. Additional Features

- Export WHOIS data: Use Laravel Excel to allow users to download WHOIS reports in .xlsx format.
- Import domain lists: Enable bulk domain lookups by allowing users to upload .csv/.xlsx/.txt files for processing.
- Mass WHOIS operations using Jobs: Use Laravel Queues and Jobs to handle bulk domain lookups.
